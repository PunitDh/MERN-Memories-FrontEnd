## Memories Front-End

This is the front-end part of the "Memories" app that I built using the full MERN Stack. This was my first MERN Stack application. I used "Material-UI" to manage the CSS front-end components and animations.

It is deployed on Netlify here: https://compassionate-ride-a9771c.netlify.app/

The back-end source code can be found here: https://github.com/PunitDh/MERN-Memories-Backend
